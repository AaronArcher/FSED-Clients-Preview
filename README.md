# FSED-Clients

This app is my first commercial app and is currently published on the App Store as an unlisted app.

An app built using SwiftUI & UIKit to geographically map the company's clients with the aim to support marketing & sales. The data is pulled from the Contentful CRM allowing the client to easily update and maintain the database without any technical knowledge.


Key features include:
- Data pulled from Contentful CRM
- Client Filtering
- Location search using MKLocalSearch
- Custom MKAnnotations & ClusterAnnotations
- User location captured using CoreLocation
- Built using MVVM Architecture
